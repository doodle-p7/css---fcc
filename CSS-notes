1. Ways to incorporate css in html: 
    a. inline
    b. internal
    c. external
    and priority of inline is the maximum and between internal and external, one that comes last will get the highest priority

2. Selectors:
    a. element 
    b. class 
    c. id   
    -> selector grouping
    p span{
    }
    ->main tag
    ->Specificity for selectors
       element<class<id
       We like to keep classes for style, ids for #links

3. CSS units and sizes
    a. px
    b. %
    c. rem
    d. em
    e. ch : the advance measure(width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font
    f. vw : 1% of the viewport's width
    g. vh : 1% of the viewport's height
    -> 16px is the default font-size of the browser
       settings - 16px
       header- h1 - 50% 
       px
       % 
    -> rem - set from root's size
    -> em - set from parent's font-size and current element when font size is set for that   element, rem - root element 
    -> Usage:
        rem => font-size
        em => padding and margins on button, titles etc.
